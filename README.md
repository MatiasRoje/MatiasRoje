# Hi, I'm MatÃ­as ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer and Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on cloud technologies, automation, and scalable solutions. My expertise includes Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Cloud Computing and modern CI/CD practices, with a passion for building efficient and resilient infrastructures.

My programming experience spans both frontend and backend development, with my core tech stack including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. While my current focus is on cloud engineering and infrastructure, I also enjoy contributing to projects that explore innovative solutions in software development.

This account is dedicated to personal projects, experimentation, and learning.
